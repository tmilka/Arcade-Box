Setup Environment

The usage of a Python Virtual Environment is recommended. To do so run:

python -m venv .venv to create the venv
source .venv/bin/activate on Linux/Mac or .venv/Script/Activate on Windows to activate the venv
If you need to deactivate the venv just run deactivate in the terminal
pip install -r requirements.txt to install all required libraries
